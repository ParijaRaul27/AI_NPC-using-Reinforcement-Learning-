# AI_NPC-using-Reinforcement-Learning-
Abstract:-
â€”Virtual Reality (VR) technologies have evolved to the extent that immersion and interactivity are at the core of user satisfaction. One of the key elements of immersive VR environments is the behavior of Non-Playable Characters (NPCs), which have hitherto been based on static, rule-based systems. This article presents a new hybrid AI methodology for NPC creation, melding conversational AI with reinforcement learning (RL) to generate dynamic, smart agents in an Unreal Engine-created VR environment. The first system uses
 Conversational AI so that NPCs are able to interact with players naturally and contextually through dialogue. The second system uses reinforcement learning to give combat NPCs adaptive tracking and attack maneuvers. Our approach shows how the synergy between machine learning, natural language processing, and live game engines increases the level of user experience.

 Tech Stacks used:- C++, Unreal Engine, HTTP request modules, JSON parsing logic, Reinforcement Learning.
